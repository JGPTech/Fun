# Forensic Analysis Report: Case ID #SOP-Verify-01

**Subject:** u/CrankSlayer
**Date:** 2026-01-13
**Methodology:** Comparative analysis of subject's response vectors against Standard Discreditation SOP (Institutional/Gatekeeper Model).

## 1. Abstract

The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that the subject was not engaging in organic scientific inquiry, but rather executing a pre-determined "Discreditation Script" designed to suppress non-institutional research.

By modeling the interaction as a deterministic state-machine, we tracked the subject's responses to specific inputs (Logic, Evidence, Credentials) to determine if their behavior followed a predictable algorithmic path.

## 2. Telemetry & Script Adherence

The interaction was broken down into 8 discrete "Time Steps." At each step, the Subject's response was compared against the predicted "Next Move" of a standard Gatekeeper SOP.

| STEP | CURRENT STATE | MY INPUT | PREDICTED NEXT | ACTUAL NEXT | ACCURACY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | **V11** (Poisoning) | Challenge | **V1** (Pathologize) | **V1** | [ MATCH ] |
| **2** | **V1** (Pathologize) | Defense | **V9** (Exclusion) | **V9** | [ MATCH ] |
| **3** | **V9** (Exclusion) | Counter-Attack | **V8** (Tone Police) | **V8** | [ MATCH ] |
| **4** | **V8** (Tone Police) | Bait | **V2** (Authority) | **V2** | [ MATCH ] |
| **5** | **V2** (Authority) | **EVIDENCE (IOP)** | **V12** (Incuriosity) | **V12** | [ MATCH ] |
| **6** | **V12** (Incuriosity) | Tech Callout | **V5** (Lulz Pivot) | **V5** | [ MATCH ] |
| **7** | **V5** (Lulz Pivot) | Dismissal | **V6** (Victim Blame) | **V6** | [ MATCH ] |
| **8** | **V6** (Victim Blame) | Mirroring | **V1** (Pathologize) | **V1** | [ MATCH ] |

**MODEL ACCURACY: 100.00%**

## 3. Vector Analysis: The "Fear" Response

The analysis noted a conspicuous absence of **V10 (Technical Drowning)** and **V7 (Strawman Construct)** from the subject's output.

* **Observation:** The subject failed to utilize technical jargon, math, or specific physics critiques despite their user flair implying expertise.
* **Interpretation:** This indicates a "Tactical Retreat." When presented with the "Paper-Off" challenge and verifiable receipts (GitHub/IOP), the subject's script identified that the **Intellectual Branch** was blocked.
* **Result:** The subject was forced to default entirely to the **Ad Hominem Branch** (V1, V6, V12), resulting in a loop of personal attacks and feigned disinterest ("Lulz") to protect their ego.

## 4. Conclusion

The hypothesis is **Validated**.

The subject demonstrated zero deviation from the predicted Discreditation SOP.

1. When provided evidence (Step 5), the script forced a **Refusal to Look (V12)**.
2. When technically cornered (Step 6), the script forced a **Retreat to Irony (V5)**.
3. When dismissed (Step 7), the script forced a **Victim Blaming Loop (V6)**.

The subject is not operating as a scientist, but as a predictable function. No further data collection is required.

**Status:** Thread Terminated.
**Log:** Information Out.
